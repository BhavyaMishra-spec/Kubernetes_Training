Voting App

Commands Used :-

-> git clone https://github.com/ashishrpandey/example-voting-app
-> cd /root/example-voting-app/k8s-specifications
-> kubectl delete all --all
-> kubectl apply -f .
-> kubectl get all

My observations :- 

1) What happened after deleting voting pod.
   -> Command :- kubectl delete pods vote-94849dc97-pstxb
   -> The voting application was working fine.
   -> A new pod was created with the name vote-94849dc97-99b2p earlier it was vote-94849dc97-pstxb.
   
2) What happened after deleting worker pod.
    -> Command :- kubectl delete pods worker-dd46d7584-mrmzh
    -> The voting application was working fine.
    -> A new pod was created with the name worker-dd46d7584-6skhc earlier it was worker-dd46d7584-mrmzh

3) What happened after db pod deletion.
   -> Command:- kubectl delete pods db-b54cd94f4-9sq7z
   -> The voting application is stopped working after deleting the db pod.We can give the vote but result is not getting updtaed.
   -> After deleting the db pod,we can see that db pod is still running with new name.
   -> The worker pod again got started.

   * Snapshort of code :- 

   [root@ip-172-31-1-250 k8s-specifications]# kubectl delete pods db-b54cd94f4-9sq7z
   pod "db-b54cd94f4-9sq7z" deleted

   [root@ip-172-31-1-250 k8s-specifications]# kubectl get pods
   NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   db-b54cd94f4-rff6h        1/1     Running   0          98s
   redis-868d64d78-pwdsm     1/1     Running   0          2d2h
   result-5d57b59f4b-xq8xr   1/1     Running   0          2d2h
   vote-94849dc97-99b2p      1/1     Running   0          50m
   worker-dd46d7584-6skhc    1/1     Running   1          46m
   
4) Why result app STOPPED working after deleting the db pod.
   ->The results app stopped after deleting db pod because the connection was lost between the result pod and the db pod.
  
  We can see the logs below why this happened.
      
   [root@ip-172-31-1-250 k8s-specifications]# kubectl logs -f result-5d57b59f4b-xq8xr

5)How to make the RESULT POD work again.
   -> The connection got established again after deleting the result pod.
      
      Snapshot :- 
      [root@ip-172-31-1-250 k8s-specifications]# kubectl get pods
      NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
