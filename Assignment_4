My observations :- 

1) What happened after deleting voting pod.
   -> Command :- kubectl delete pods vote-94849dc97-pstxb
   -> The voting application was working fine.
   -> A new pod was created with the name vote-94849dc97-99b2p earlier it was vote-94849dc97-pstxb.
   
2) What happened after deleting worker pod.
    -> Command :- kubectl delete pods worker-dd46d7584-mrmzh
    -> The voting application was working fine.
    -> A new pod was created with the name worker-dd46d7584-6skhc earlier it was worker-dd46d7584-mrmzh

3) What happened after db pod deletion.
   -> Command:- kubectl delete pods db-b54cd94f4-9sq7z
   -> The voting application is stopped working after deleting the db pod.We can give the vote but result is not getting updtaed.
   -> After deleting the db pod,we can see that db pod is still running with new name.
   -> The worker pod again got started.
